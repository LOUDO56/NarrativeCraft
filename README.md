## Concept

Minecraft is a great game for creating cinematic shots, as you can customize everything, resource packs, shaders, mods... And since Minecraft is a sandbox game, why not have the possibility to create an interactive story within it?

In Minecraft, you already have the foundation: a 3D game world, characters, skins, resource packs, mods, shaders. The only limit is your imagination. This mod is aimed at people who find it hard to make video games themselves but want to tell powerful stories, or map makers who want to add more storytelling.

## Features

- Ink integration
- Support for custom triggers and commands
- Made to be accessible to anybody
- Organized structure
- Customizable (main screen, credits, dialogues...)
- All-in-one system (player recording, cutscenes, multiple recordings at the same time)

## Mod compatibility
- EmoteCraft: Emotes will be recorded, and you can play them from ink script.

## How does it work?

NarrativeCraft uses a narrative scripting language called [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), which is open-source and highly scalable for integration into other projects. The Java integration was made by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder/).

Ink is a great narrative scripting language because:
- It's easy to learn.
- Dialogues come first, logic later.
- It has enough advanced features to create complex stories.

NarrativeCraft is the middleman that interprets your dialogues and events as in-game actions.  
By events, I mean custom lines you can write to trigger in-game actions. For example, changing the time, weather, playing cutscenes...

## What does it look like in-game?

I'm glad you asked! I made a small showcase to demonstrate what this mod is capable of:

## I want to start making stories

You can start learning from the NarrativeCraft [documentation](https://loudo56.github.io/NarrativeCraft-docs/getting-started/introduction-to-narrativecraft.html).

## Contribution

This mod is meant to be developed and used with the community. My goal is to make story creation easily accessible to as many people as possible.

If you're experienced in Minecraft modding or Java in general, any suggestions to refactor or improve the code are greatly appreciated.
