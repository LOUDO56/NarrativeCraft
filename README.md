NarrativeCraft is an open-source minecraft mod that allows you to create interactive stories in Minecraft (Yes, like Minecraft Story Mode).
This mod is aimed to have a user-friendly way to create stories, from player animation to cutscene and creating dialogues.

Here's a prototype I made 1.5 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZl5FM3JZmA (note that it's not a mod, but made with skript with 3 plugins, but everything expect script dialogue is made from scracth here)


**Note:** The dialog display mode will be replaced by progressive text accompanied by a small sound when a letter appears, as well as manual interaction via input to move on to the next dialog.


# Ink support
This mod will have [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) as a support to create dialogues!
Ink is a powerful scripting tool to create story driven games, with multiple choices and logic added to it, it's designed to be easy to understand!

# What this mod will be capable of
The goal of this mod is to add more emotions to your minecraft adventure map, adding characters, choices and cutscenes.
## Record
To make your story more immersive, characters in your story will **move like a real player**, that you pre-recorded yourself.
EmoteCraft is planned to be supported, to have more vivid characters.
## Cutscenes
You'll have the ability to create cutscenes directly in the game, as well as adding triggers e.g command, sound, changing time...
## Dialogues
Ink will do most of the work to handle dialogues, based players's choice. Moreover, custom commands will be added to perfectly sync records and cutscenes that you will write in your `.ink` file.
